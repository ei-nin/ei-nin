ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ei-nin
 - Iâ€™m interested in coding, UI/UX, and design. I'm working my way towards becoming a junior front end developer, with sights on full stack. 
- Iâ€™m currently working as a bartender whilst teaching myself front-end basics, HTML, and JavaScript (just to begin with!). I'm hoping to start learning React soon.
